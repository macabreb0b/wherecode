This is a simple application for delivering a coded message to multiple recipients. Specifically designed to work with address data, as for party planning. Assume recipients know where to input the code when they receive it (wherecode.herokuapp.com for now), this will act as an easy-to-remember key to all the details for a party.

Next time you're trying to get somewhere and struggling to find the address, use a WhereCode!
